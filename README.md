Hi... I'm Jay... "new" to coding... and by "new" I mean... I'm pretty damn fresh... 

Self teaching... and been doing so for about 5 months now. I have learned a lot and feel pretty good honestly about where I am with my coding knowledge... Hints why I'm here doing this... 
I'm extrememly comfortable with my HTML and CSS skills (Of course I don't know everything). But, I am confident in those areas. I am currently practicing/learning Javascript and am trying to get my vanilla JS skills down really well before I move into trying to learn things like node and react.
I currently am interested in front-end/web-development (figured it was the easiest to get into) but am excited and ready to learn ANYTHING. Back-end stuff is very intersting as well.

I love to really get to know the ins and outs of how things work, get that basic understanding of how and why. Really helps when you get stuck somewhere. And that has made coding so much fun. Very detail oriented. 

I come from a background of cooking, I've been in the restaurant industry for 12 years now. And while it was fun and I enjoyed my time in it... I am VERY burnt out. I'm tired of missing family events, all the holidays, weekends, and just.. life in general...

The problem with the service industry is.. well.. I'm always the one providing other people with their holiday, event, celebration. Long hours, late nights, dirty, greasy, hot, stressful, loud. It's just a lot, and you miss out on a lot. Plus the pay isn't all that great for what you're doing.. AND there's zero benifits. No PTO, no sick days, no health benifits. If you have to call out for some reason you feel bad because you're letting the team down and more than likely made the whole teams day harder. And you can get in trouble for it.

I'm tired, and want something different. So, I'm trying to bust my ass and learn this so I can have something different.
